## 🔬 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Vector Store Architecture:**
- **Embeddings**: 384-dimensional vectors from SentenceTransformers
- **Index**: FAISS IndexFlatIP for cosine similarity
- **Chunking**: 200-1000 tokens with 100-token overlap
- **Metadata**: Company, year, section, page number preservation

### **Agent Workflow (LangGraph):**
```python
1. Query Classification → Simple/Complex
2. Query Decomposition → Sub-queries (if complex)
3. Multi-step Retrieval → Vector searches
4. Result Synthesis → LLM combines results
5. Response Formation → JSON with sources
```

### **Query Processing Examples:**

**Simple Query:**
```
"What was Microsoft's revenue in 2023?"
→ Single search → Direct answer
```

**Complex Query:**
```
"Which company had highest margin in 2023?"
→ Decompose: ["MSFT margin 2023", "GOOGL margin 2023", "NVDA margin 2023"]
→ 3 searches → Compare → "Microsoft: 42.1%"
```

## 📊 **Performance Metrics**

- **Setup Time**: ~5-10 minutes (with real data download)
- **Demo Time**: ~30 seconds (with sample data)
- **Query Processing**: 1-5 seconds per query
- **Vector Search**: <1 second
