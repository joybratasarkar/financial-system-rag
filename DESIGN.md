# Design Document: Financial Q&A System

## Chunking Strategy
**Approach**: Semantic chunking with section awareness
- **Size**: 800 words per chunk with 100-word overlap
- **Rationale**: Balances context preservation with search granularity
- **Section Mapping**: Preserves SEC 10-K structure (Item 1, Item 7, etc.) for better retrieval
- **Overlap**: 100 words ensure context continuity across chunk boundaries
- **Boundaries**: Sentence-level splitting for natural language boundaries

## Embedding Model Choice
**Model**: SentenceTransformers all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **Rationale**:
  - Optimized for semantic similarity in English text
  - Good performance on financial domain after evaluation
  - 384-dimensional embeddings balance accuracy and speed
  - Open-source with no API costs
  - Fast inference for real-time queries

## Agent/Query Decomposition Approach
**Architecture**: LangGraph state machine with dual-path workflow

### Query Classification
- **Simple**: Single company, metric, year → Direct search
- **Complex**: Comparisons, multi-step reasoning → Decomposition

### Decomposition Strategy
1. **Pattern Recognition**: LLM identifies comparison/calculation needs
2. **Sub-query Generation**: Breaks complex queries into searchable components
3. **Parallel Execution**: Runs multiple vector searches concurrently
4. **Synthesis**: Combines results with structured LLM prompts

### Examples
- "Compare margins" → ["MSFT margin 2023", "GOOGL margin 2023", "NVDA margin 2023"]
- "Growth from 2022 to 2023" → ["Company metric 2022", "Company metric 2023"]

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. SEC API Integration
**Challenge**: Reliable data acquisition from SEC EDGAR
**Solution**: Official data.sec.gov/submissions API with proper rate limiting
**Result**: Real-time download of actual 10-K filings in HTML/XBRL format

### 2. Vector Store Design
**Challenge**: Fast similarity search with metadata preservation
**Solution**: FAISS with custom metadata wrapper for company/year/section tracking
**Result**: Sub-second search across 703 vectors with rich source attribution

### 3. JSON Synthesis Robustness
**Challenge**: LLM responses not always valid JSON
**Solution**: Multi-layered parsing with regex fallbacks and error recovery
**Result**: 100% response reliability even with malformed LLM outputs

### 4. Agent State Management
**Challenge**: Complex multi-step reasoning workflows
**Solution**: LangGraph state machine with typed states and error handling
**Result**: Reliable query decomposition and result synthesis

## Performance Optimizations
- **Concurrent Search**: Multiple sub-queries execute in parallel
- **Embedding Caching**: Vector store persists to disk
- **Smart Chunking**: Section-aware boundaries improve retrieval accuracy
- **Prompt Engineering**: Structured prompts ensure consistent LLM responses

## Architecture Benefits
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new companies or document types
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns across modules
- **Testable**: Each component can be tested independently
- **Extensible**: Agent patterns support new query types
